we explored various clustering techniques and their applications in analyzing geographic data through the lens of Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. We implemented K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify patterns within our dataset, examining how different features and parameters influenced clustering results. We learned to evaluate the effectiveness of our clustering through metrics like the Normalized Mutual Information Score (NMI), which helped us assess the relationship between our cluster labels and RUCA codes. Additionally, we conducted experiments involving feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and a grid search for optimal clustering configurations. Throughout this process, we also encountered the importance of data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and scaling numerical features. Finally, we documented our findings, providing insights into the implications of clustering results while recognizing the limitations and potential areas for further research in the context of demographic data.
