In this assignment, we undertook a comprehensive data preparation and model-building process to predict flight delays. Beginning with data cleaning and the handling of null values, we split the dataset into training and testing sets and scaled numerical features for consistency. Employing feature selection with SelectKBest, we identified and optimized a subset of features most influential in predicting delays. We implemented and fine-tuned a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model using cross-validation, refining model parameters through a grid search over the number of neighbors, weights, and selected features. This methodical approach provided insights into feature importance and allowed us to iteratively enhance the modelâ€™s performance across metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC, resulting in a robust framework for future improvements.
