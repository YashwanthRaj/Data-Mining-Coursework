# Data Mining 

# Class 1 - Introduction to Data Mining
We are faced with large amount of data which we want to get information/knowledge. Data Mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns, models, and other kinds of knowledge in large data sets. 

We explored various practical aspects of handling and analyzing data. We began by downloading multiple CSV files from a public dataset, organizing them, and ensuring they were properly downloaded. Next, we used DuckDB to perform SQL queries, including creating temporary views, aggregating data, and executing different types of queries. We analyzed loan data by identifying top SBA offices, examining the distribution of loans across NAICS codes, and exploring loan frequencies by business age. We also used Matplotlib to visualize the frequency distribution of NAICS sectors and summarize loan amounts through various charts. Additionally, we calculated key statistics such as minimum, median, average, standard deviation, and maximum for loan approval amounts. 

# Class 2 - Dimensional Modeling Design Matrix
In this class, we began by working with movie data, including ratings, movies, tags, and genres. We created various tables to organize and analyze the data, starting with user information derived from their earliest reviews and then focusing on movies and genres. We also built a comprehensive date dimension table to provide detailed date-related information. With the fact tables, like ratings, in place, we performed queries to find insights, such as identifying movies with the most reviews. We then created a user table that included information on the number of reviews and average ratings for each user, and another table to analyze genre-specific ratings. To measure user similarity, we computed Euclidean distances and cosine similarities, using these measures to identify the most similar and dissimilar users. Finally, we normalized the data and compared users based on their ratings to better understand their similarities and differences.
