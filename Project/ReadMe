Credit Card Fraud Detection

Credit card fraud represents a significant challenge to the banking industry, with global losses
projected to reach $43 billion by 2026. This report addresses the critical issue of credit card fraud
detection by analyzing a dataset containing transactions from European cardholders over two days
in September 2013. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent,
highlighting the severe class imbalance. To address this issue, various resampling techniques, such
as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), Random Over-Sampling, ADASYN
(Adaptive Synthetic Sampling), Borderline-SMOTE, and SMOTETomek, were applied to balance
the dataset and enhance the model's ability to detect fraud. These resampling methods are designed
to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (fraudulent transactions), thus enabling the
classifiers to better learn the patterns associated with fraud.

Several machine learning classifiers were employed to evaluate their performance in fraud
detection, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Logistic
Regression. These models were selected for their effectiveness in classification tasks and their
ability to handle class imbalance. The report investigates how each model performs with the
different resampling techniques, analyzing key evaluation metric PR AUC (Precision-Recall Area
Under the Curve), to assess their ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while
minimizing false positives. By comparing the results of these models, the project highlights the
strengths and limitations of each approach in tackling credit card fraud detection, offering insights
into the potential use of machine learning in combating financial crimes.
