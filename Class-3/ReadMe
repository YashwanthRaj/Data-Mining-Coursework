So far, we have been working on a data mining project involving the MovieLens dataset. We started by exploring and querying the dataset to understand the distribution of movie ratings, particularly focusing on high-rated movies and the relationships between them. We created and manipulated tables to identify frequently co-rated movies and generated candidate itemsets of various sizes. Using these itemsets, we calculated support and confidence for association rules, ultimately constructing a table of rules to analyze movie recommendations. Weâ€™ve also examined specific movie IDs to find recommendations based on frequent itemsets that include both movies, setting up queries to derive and present potential suggestions.
