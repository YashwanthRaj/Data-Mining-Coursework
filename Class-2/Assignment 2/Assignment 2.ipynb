    "To improve how we extract years from movie titles, we should start by refining our regular expressions to accurately capture the year. Better regex patterns can help ensure we’re getting the year right from the title. It’s also better to handle special cases where numbers in the title might be mistaken for a year. For example, a title like \"The 300 Spartans\" includes a number that isn’t a year. We should implement validation checks to make sure the extracted years are valid and fall within a sensible range. Lastly, cross-referencing the extracted data with external sources like IMDb can help us verify and correct the title and year information, ensuring our dataset is as accurate as possible."
