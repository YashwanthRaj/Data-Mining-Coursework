    "# Homework 5: Supervised Learning, part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review\n",
    "\n",
    "In class #6, we spoke about the importance of having a strong process for building supervised models. It can be very easy to fool yourself into thinking you have a much stronger model than you do!  Some of the common issues we discussed were:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not having a strong process for evaluating model performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is absolutely required to have a separate \"test\" set that you look at as few times as possible.\n",
    "* To avoid using your test set, you should use one of the following strategies to choose your model hyperparameters, features, etc:\n",
    "    * A separate \"validation set\"\n",
    "    * Cross-folds validation (CV)\n",
    "* The modeling task you are working on may help you decide which strategy to use. Some forecasting/prediction problems may benefit from both the test set and validation set being \"out of time\" samples. In other cases, random sampling (of either the test set or through CV can be useful\n",
    "* Standard prediction metrics are very useful, but may not be sufficient to capture whether the model works for your business problem\n",
    "    * Standard metrics can include:\n",
    "        * Precision, Recall, F-score, Area Under the ROC Curve, Area under the Precision-Recall Curve for classification\n",
    "        * Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc. for regression (we will discuss this more later on)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not doing enough work with _Feature Engineering_ or _Feature Selection_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature engineering is the 'art' of generating features that are better aligned with the domain and prediction problem you are working with.\n",
    "    * We brainstormed a number of features for the airplane delay prediction, including external data like weather forecasts and deriving features based on the recent number of flights or delays at an airport (or by aircraft type)\n",
    "* Feature selection is the process of narrowing down the features that you use in a model\n",
    "    * Some classifiers are more sensitive to \"noisy\" features than others (like the _KNN_ method we discussed last class)\n",
    "    * Even for classifiers that are more robust to noisy features, they add no value to the model and can cause issues later, either higher variance or being more prone to data errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment: building a classification model for airline delays\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict whether our flight is going to be delayed so we know whether we should leave for the aiport yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make the prediction 6 hours before it is supposed to be delayed. We're choosing 6 hours to balance two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is useful (we haven't left for the airport yet) unlike a model that predicts 5 minutes in advance.\n",
    "* It is close enough to the flight time that we can incorporate information about the _current day_ in terms of delays\n",

    "\n",
    "For AIRLINE CODE, ORIGIN, DESTINATION, MONTH, etc. we want to create lagging features that are the rates of delays for that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for United Airlines (UA) and for a flight on 6/1/2022, we want features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* UA % delayed yesterday\n",
    "* UA % delayed in past 7 days\n",
    "* UA % delayed in past 30 days\n",
    "* UA % delayed in past 365 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are now using 365 days of history for features, we can't use the first 365 days of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we may want to \"throw out\" all the \"COVID era\" data, so our training data will start on 2022-01-01\n",
    "\n",
    "I've already written a version of these features using window functions in SQL/DuckDB to get you started\n"

Features such as 1-day delays and 1-day average delays provide an understanding of immediate operational issues, reflecting short-term disruptions in the airline’s performance. In contrast, the 7-day average delays indicate emerging short-term trends, capturing how performance evolves over a slightly longer period. Additionally, the 30-day and 365-day average delays highlight patterns in the airline's performance over longer timeframes, offering a view of sustained issues and historical trends.\n",
