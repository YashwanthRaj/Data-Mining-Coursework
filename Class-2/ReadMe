# Class 2 - Dimensional Modeling Design Matrix

In this class, we began by working with movie data, including ratings, movies, tags, and genres. We created various tables to organize and analyze the data, starting with user information derived from their earliest reviews and then focusing on movies and genres. We also built a comprehensive date dimension table to provide detailed date-related information. With the fact tables, like ratings, in place, we performed queries to find insights, such as identifying movies with the most reviews. We then created a user table that included information on the number of reviews and average ratings for each user, and another table to analyze genre-specific ratings. To measure user similarity, we computed Euclidean distances and cosine similarities, using these measures to identify the most similar and dissimilar users. Finally, we normalized the data and compared users based on their ratings to better understand their similarities and differences.
